<p>How do you know when you love what you do? For me, if i was not paid to write cool scripts and programs, I would be doing this anyway.</p>

<p>I enjoy being able to automate tedious and boring things.</p>

<p>I love the challenge of writing efficient yet simple code.</p>

<p>I dislike knowing that there is always gonna be someone lightyears better than me at the same thing.</p>

<p>I dislike the fact that no matter how much you study and apply yourself, there is still more to learn.</p>

<p>I currently write code mostly in Python, Golang, Bash. I plan to write code for the rest of my life, whether Im paid to do it or not :)</p>

<p>This is my first really simple little post.
I hope to post more interesting things here as I journey through writing more code in a production environment.</p>
