How do you know when you love what you do? For me, if i was not paid to write cool scripts and programs, I would be doing this anyway.

I enjoy being able to automate tedious and boring things.

I love the challenge of writing efficient yet simple code.

I dislike knowing that there is always gonna be someone lightyears better than me at the same thing.

I dislike the fact that no matter how much you study and apply yourself, there is still more to learn.

I currently write code mostly in Python, Golang, Bash. I plan to write code for the rest of my life, whether Im paid to do it or not :)

This is my first really simple little post.
I hope to post more interesting things here as I journey through writing more code in a production environment.

orevwa!

{% highlight python %}
while True: write_code()
